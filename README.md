# Notion Job Tracker Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that helps you save job listings to a Notion job tracker database.

## Features

- Extract job information automatically from popular job listing sites:
  - LinkedIn
  - Indeed
  - Glassdoor
  - Google Jobs
- Save job details directly to your Notion job tracker database
- Track application status and add notes
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Notion Integration

1. Go to [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click "New integration"
3. Name your integration (e.g., "Job Tracker Chrome Extension")
4. Select the workspace where your job tracker database is located
5. Grant the required capabilities (read & write content)
6. Click "Submit" to create your integration
7. Copy your "Internal Integration Token" (you'll need this later)

### 2. Create a Job Tracker Database in Notion

Create a database in Notion with the following properties:
- Company (Title)
- Position (Text)
- Location (Text)
- URL (URL)
- Date Added (Date)
- Status (Select) with options like:
  - Interested
  - Applied
  - Interview
  - Offer
  - Rejected
  - Not Interested
- Salary (Text)
- Description (Text) - For storing the full job description
- Notes (Text)

### 3. Share Your Database with the Integration

1. Open your job tracker database in Notion
2. Click "Share" in the top right corner
3. In the "Add people, emails, groups, or integrations" field, search for and select your integration
4. Click "Invite"

### 4. Find Your Database ID

1. Open your job tracker database in Notion
2. Look at the URL. It should look something like: `https://www.notion.so/workspace/83c75a51f3b3429983c75a51f3b342d8?v=...`
3. The database ID is the part after the workspace name and before the `?v=...` parameter
4. In this example, the database ID would be `83c75a51f3b3429983c75a51f3b342d8`

### 5. Install and Configure the Chrome Extension

1. Download the extension files or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files
5. Click on the extension icon in your browser toolbar
6. Go to the settings page and enter your Notion API token and database ID
7. Save your settings

## How to Use

1. Navigate to a job listing page on a supported site
2. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar
3. The form will be auto-filled with job details extracted from the page:
   - For LinkedIn, the extension can extract from various page layouts and formats
   - Automatically pulls company name, position title, location, salary, and full job description
   - Extracts job descriptions using specific selectors like `jobs-description__container` for LinkedIn
   - Extracts salary information from job descriptions when not explicitly listed
4. Review and edit the information as needed
5. Select the appropriate status for the job
6. Add any notes about the position
7. Click "Save to Notion" to add the job to your database

## Privacy

Your Notion API token and database ID are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage system and are never sent to any third-party servers. All communication happens directly between your browser and Notion's API.

## Troubleshooting

### Notion API Issues

If you encounter errors when saving jobs to Notion, here are some common issues and solutions:

#### Error: "body.properties.Company.id should be defined"

This error occurs when the Notion API format has changed or your database structure doesn't match the expected format. The extension now automatically adapts to your database structure by:

1. Fetching your database schema before submitting job data
2. Matching property names case-insensitively
3. Using the correct property types based on your database structure

Make sure that:
- Your database has a "Company" property that's set as the Title property
- Your Notion integration has permission to access the database
- You've entered the correct Database ID and API token in the extension settings

#### Error: "Title property does not have the correct configuration"

Every Notion database must have exactly one "title" property. Make sure your database has a property (usually "Company") set as the Title property type in Notion.

#### Error: "Property values do not match schema"

This happens when the data sent doesn't match the property types in your database. Check that:
- Your database has all the fields listed in the Setup Instructions
- The property types match (Rich Text, Date, Select, URL, etc.)

#### Error: "Content exceeds maximum length" 

Notion has a limit of 2000 characters for rich text properties. If job descriptions are too long, the extension will automatically truncate them.
